FUCK - Fantastic User Command Kit

------------------------------------------------------
  INSTALL
------------------------------------------------------

1) Put the "ffuck" script somewhere in your PATH 
   (e.g. ~/bin or /usr/local/bin or /opt) and give
   it execution privilegies.
   

2) Add the following alias:

   alias fuck='. ffuck'

   to one of your shell initialization scripts 
   (e.g. ~/.bashrc or /etc/bash.bashrc).
 
------------------------------------------------------
  UNINSTALL
------------------------------------------------------

1) undo INSTALL.2
2) undo INSTALL.1

Surprisingly, it seems to work also in reverse order!

Fill free to perform them in parallel to get the 
most out of your multicore processor.
